# AI-Driven Cloth Properties Detection

## Project Overview
The **AI-Driven Cloth Properties Detection** project leverages deep learning techniques to classify cloth properties from ultra-high-resolution images. This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy in detecting and classifying various cloth attributes.

### Key Features:
- Developed an AI model for precise classification of cloth properties.
- Utilized a balanced and well-annotated dataset to ensure robust machine learning performance.
- Achieved **91% accuracy** after extensive hyperparameter tuning with CNNs.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following tools installed:

### Required Software:
- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **Jupyter Notebook** ([Installation Guide](https://jupyter.org/install#jupyter-notebook))
- **pip** ([Installation Guide](https://pypi.org/project/pip/))

### Optional Tools:
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- **Google Colab**

## Installation
1. Ensure Python and pip are installed on your system.
2. Install Jupyter Notebook using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install notebook
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/AI-Driven-Cloth-Properties-Detection.git
   ```
4. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AI-Driven-Cloth-Properties-Detection
   ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset used for training and testing consists of high-resolution images annotated with cloth property labels.
- Make sure the dataset is placed in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`main.ipynb`) in your Jupyter environment.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess the dataset
   - Train the CNN model
   - Evaluate the results

## Results
